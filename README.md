# Race Population by Censuns Blocks
- Project description
    - This "Race Population by Census Blocks 2020" web GIS application shows King County's 2020 Census Blocks Group population by race. The basic map shows King County divided based on Census Blocks Groups. Each Census Block Group was divided into colors based on the total population in the group. The race group consists of "White", "Black", "Native American", "Asian", "Pacific Islander", and "Other Races Alone". The user can click on the desired Census Block to get information about the number of races in it. 

- Project goal (such as, what is the message you want to deliver through your project?)
    - I wanted to know how King County, where the University of Washington students, including myself, live, is geographically divided by race. I wanted to share how much we live separately by race.
